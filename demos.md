# List of demos for class

This page aggregates all demos shown in class.  A lot of these demos will be live coded in class to varying levels of success - these are the "working" versions of what is intended to be shown.

**Note**: these will mainly use the Three.js library - please see the [setup guide](setup.md) for how to get up and running with a local development environment!
