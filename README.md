## Learning Objectives

Computer graphics play a key role in many applications, from video games to advanced medical simulations. This course provides an introduction to the theory and application of computer graphics programming in both 2D and 3D. Students will use WebGL and Unity (and possibly Godot) in several programming projects that will provide experience in graphics programming topics such as drawing, collision detection, user interaction, and texturing. An emphasis on practical experience with graphics concepts will be emphasized.

Specifically, students will:

* Create images of 3D objects using a standard graphics API
* Use a standard API to apply basic transformations (scaling, rotation, translation) to 3D objects
* Develop programs that use multiple 3D coordinate frames for controlling different parts of a 3D object
* Describe the techniques used for hidden-surface removal
* Demonstrate the results of clipping algorithms between lines and polygons

## Lecture

Class meets 2 times a week in person.  Typically class will comprise a lecture with some in-class assignments sprinkled throughout.  These are due the **next day by 11:59pm**.  Ensure you keep up on these, as they factor into the Participation part of your grade.  

**Note**: I will not accept late in-class assignment submissions - no exceptions.

---

## Term Project

There will be a 1/2 semester-long term project (individual or team, your choice).  Check out the [term projects page](term-projects) for more details.

---

## Assignments

All assignments are due by 11:59pm on the date they are due.  Please check Blackboard regularly for upcoming due dates.  If you are struggling or are having problems, please contact me in advance.  If you message me or email me the night something is due I will most likely not accept your reasoning.  If you get in touch early then we can work it out.

* Assignment late penalty: 10% per day (including weekends)
* Late in-class assignment submissions are **not accepted**

### Submissions

* All course content is hosted on this page.
* **All assignment submissions are to be submitted via [Blackboard](https://lms.gvsu.edu){:target="_blank"}!**
